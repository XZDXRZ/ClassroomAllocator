# ClassroomAllocator

## Client Brief

The Classroom Allocation System is a software application designed to efficiently manage and allocate classrooms to teachers/professors and students
for academic purposes. The purpose of this software is to assist the manager with the process of handling classroom booking orders and avoiding schedule
conflicts. The functionalities this software will include are:
1. Allow professors and students to submit classroom booking orders, which include the desired time and number of classrooms.
2. In case of conflicts, the system will decline and alert the client who sends the order later to change their order.
3. Automatically allocate classrooms based on availability and order.
The software’s scope covers the whole process of booking classrooms, but does not include automatically changing the booking if there is a conflict.

## Scopes

The solution will receive the bookings for classrooms from teachers/professors and students, they may choose classrooms of their preference.
The system will decline their order if there is a clash of time and classrooms. If not, the system will displace the classrooms they’ve successfully
booked for the time period. But this software can only allocate classrooms through the total number of classrooms, but cannot guarantee the same classrooms
will be allocated throughout the time period. And when in case of order conflicts, the solution cannot allocate/settle the conflict automatically, the user
has to change their time manually.

## Operating Environment
